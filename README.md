## Introduction
> Inspired by [Zhejiang University course guide sharing plan](https://github.com/QSCTech/zju-icicles) and [Tsinghua University Computer Science Department course guide](https://github.com/Salensoft/thu-cst-cracker), this project was created.

## Preface
> As mentioned in the course guide of Zhejiang University, when we come to a university, from the first contact with many courses until we complete them one by one, we often collect a lot of information and intelligence in the process.

Some are e-books that need to be searched online, every time you see a new course, Google the name of the textbook. Some can be found immediately, while others require a lot of eyesight. Some are past test papers or A4 papers, which have been carefully compiled by predecessors, collecting and making, with the idea that it can be useful to others, is made public, but it needs to be explored in various groups or privately and passed down from generation to generation from seniors. Some skills are suddenly understood after taking a course, which turns out to be the focus of this course, could have been done better and easier.

I have also worked very hard to collect various course materials, but in the end, the acquisition of some important information is often purely accidental. This state often makes me feel scared and uneasy. I also finally had some methods and conclusions after the course, but these ideas had no place to express. In the end, I could only dissipate the experience gained by spending time and energy in the long oblivion.

Every time I come across information from my seniors, it is like finding a treasure. Every time after the exam, my summary and hard work are thrown away like worn out shoes.

We hope to turn these obscure, uncertain, and word-of-mouth information and experiences into open, easily accessible and shared information that everyone can improve and accumulate together.

We hope that as long as **it is a detour taken by our predecessors, future generations will not have to take it again**. Everyone's energy and time should be wasted on areas worth wasting.

## Platform
### Why use GitHub projects as the platform?
- Most QQ/WeChat groups are separated by grade and major, which cannot be maintained together for a long time, and group files are also lack of organization.
- GitHub projects can use directories to organize files, and each directory can display a `README` while displaying the file list, which is very suitable for the needs of this project.
- GitHub comes with convenient `Issue` and `Pull Request` collaboration functions, and we can easily monitor and adjust the quality of your contributions.

### What information to upload?
- Course selection guide
- Electronic version of textbooks
- Daily homework answers
- Previous examination papers
- Review materials
- Excellent code cases
