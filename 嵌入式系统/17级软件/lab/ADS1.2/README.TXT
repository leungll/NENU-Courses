			 ADS 1.2 Release Notes
			 ---------------------

This CD contains the ARM Developer Suite (ADS) version 1.2.  The Windows and
Unix versions of ADS are separate products and the CD will be valid either for
Windows platforms, or for Unix platforms.  The printed CD label contains a list
of the valid platforms.


The Getting Started guide describes differences between ADS 1.2 and the
previous ADS 1.1 toolkit.  It also describes differences between ADS 1.1 and
the earlier ARM Software Development Toolkit (SDT).  If you are moving to ADS
from SDT you are strongly advised to read these sections as there are major
differences and improvements in ADS.  The Getting Started guide is part of the
supplied documentation and is also available as a Dynatext version after
installation, and optionally (depending on your installation choices) as a PDF
version.


The following information relating to the installation process (and covering
all platforms) may be useful:

 Before you can use ADS 1.2, you will need to install a license file.
  Details of how to install the temporary license key provided with ADS 1.2
  and how to request a permanent license file are contained in the ADS
  Installation and License Management Guide.

 ADS 1.2 uses a different license key from that used with ADS 1.1, ADS
  1.0.1 or ADS 1.0.  If you are upgrading from an earlier ADS, you will need
  to uninstall the earlier version, install ADS 1.2 and then request a new
  license file as detailed in the ADS Installation and License Management
Guide.

 Once you have received your license file, if you require assistance with
  its installation, please consult our License Management FAQ within the
  Technical Support area of the ARM web site.  Further advice on license
  installation can be obtained from license.support@arm.com.  Ensure that you
  provide your ADS serial number and license file with all such enquiries.

 Technical support in the use of ADS 1.2 should be obtained from your
  supplier.  Contact details should have been provided on the sticker on the
  outside of your ADS 1.2 box and also within your license file.  They will
  also be displayed when you enter 'armcc -help' at the command line.

 The supported hardware platforms are described in the ADS Installation
  and License Management Guide.  For Windows platforms, the following
  Versions/Service Packs are recommended:
  - Windows NT 4 - Service Pack 5 or above.
  - Windows 2000 - ServicePack 1 
  - Windows 98 - Second Edition
  - Windows 95 - version 2
