AS950 ARM APPLICATIONS LIBRARY V1.1
===================================

This document lists each of the components of the ARM Applications 
Library and provides general information.


Components
__________

The ARM Applications Library contains components for:

Non-compliant Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation  arm_adpm
Bit Manipulation Routines                                  arm_bitm
Discrete Cosine Transform                                  arm_dct
Fast Fourier Transform                                     arm_fft
Filters                                                    arm_fil
- Finite Impulse Response                                  arm_fir
- Infinite Impulse Response                                arm_iir
- Least Mean Square                                        arm_lms
G.711                                                      arm_g711
Huffman Encoding/Decoding                                  arm_huff
IS54 Convolutional Encoder                                 arm_is54
Mathematics                                                arm_math
Multi-Tone Multi-Frequency Generation/Detection            arm_mtmf

A general C utility library, util_lib, which is used for demonstrating 
each of the main components, is also included.

Within each component, there is a subset of the following folders:

src       - the C test routine and the ARM and C source files specific 
            to the component
tstfiles  - the test files that can be used to demonstrate the 
            component

At the root level of each component, there are two .mcp project 
files for use with the ARM Developer Suite, version 1.0.
